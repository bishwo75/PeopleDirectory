To make project production-ready, 
I have updated tsconfig.json and for better performance, maintainability type-checking, 
I have configured  build process for cross-platform compatibility,.


Updated package.json with below dependencies 
 "fs-extra": "^11.1.1",
"typescript": "^4.9.4" 

Created a build.js file in your project root to handle file operations in a cross-platform manner
